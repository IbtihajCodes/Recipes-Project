    <h2>Pakistani Karahi</h2>
    <p>
      This dish gets its name from a karahi, a flat open pot used a lot in
      Pakistani and Indian cooking. In spite of its name, this recipe can be
      made in any pot. My mom came up with this recipe; it's a little spicy (by
      Pakistani standards), but simple and foolproof.
