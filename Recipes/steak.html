    <h2>Tomahawk Steak</h2>
    <p>
      This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing
      with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection
      with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives.
      I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the
      perfect medium-rare internal temperature.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Brown Sugar</li>
      <li>Montreal Steak Seasoning</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Onion Powder</li>
      <li>Tomahawk Steak</li>
      <li>Salted Butter</li>
      <li>Minced Shallot</li>
      <li>Minced Garlic Clove</li>
      <li>Fresh Chives</li>
      <li>Steak Rub</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rub brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion
        powder in an airtight container.
      </li>
      <li>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top</li>
      <li>
        Place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons
        steak rub in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the
        chill off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need
        an instant-read thermometer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>Remove steak from the oven.</li>
      <li>
        Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both
        sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        The internal temperature should now read 125<sup>o</sup>F to
        135<sup>o</sup>F (51 - 57 <sup>o</sup>C) for medium rare.
      </li>
      <li>Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.</li>
      <li>
        Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots,
        and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter.</li>
      <li>Be sure to serve the bone, someone will want to gnaw on it!</li>
    </ol>
