    <h2>Chicken Birayni</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
